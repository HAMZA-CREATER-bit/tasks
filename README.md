Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset (Iris Dataset)
Description

This task focuses on understanding a dataset through exploration and visualization. The Iris dataset is loaded and inspected to study its structure, features, and distributions. Descriptive statistics and visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots are used to identify patterns, relationships, and outliers in the data. This task builds foundational skills in data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA), which are essential steps before applying machine learning models.
