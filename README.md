Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset (Iris Dataset)
Description

This task focuses on understanding a dataset through exploration and visualization. The Iris dataset is loaded and inspected to study its structure, features, and distributions. Descriptive statistics and visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots are used to identify patterns, relationships, and outliers in the data. This task builds foundational skills in data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA), which are essential steps before applying machine learning models.
Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction
Description

This task involves building a classification model to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on medical attributes. The dataset is cleaned and analyzed using exploratory data analysis to understand health trends. A classification algorithm is trained to make predictions, and model performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve. This task demonstrates the application of machine learning in healthcare and medical decision support systems.

Task 6: House Price Prediction
Description

This task aims to predict house prices using property-related features such as size, number of bedrooms, and location. The dataset is preprocessed to handle numerical features, and a regression model is trained to learn price patterns. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). This task demonstrates the use of regression models in real-world economic and real estate applications.
